# My First NFT Collection

I created a user-friendly interface using React and NextJS, making it easy for users to interact with the NFT contract. Additionally, I developed a Solidity contract to facilitate actions such as minting NFTs and retrieving information about the total number of tokens minted, among other functionalities. This contract is deployed on the Goerli network, ensuring a seamless and decentralized experience.
